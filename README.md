# <ins>Project Name</ins> :- TO-DO LIST APPLICATION WITH LOCAL STORAGE

This HTML code creates the structure for a "To-Do List" web application with an interface for adding, displaying, and organizing tasks. Here's an overview of its key elements:

1. **HTML Document Structure**:
   - **Doctype Declaration**: Specifies that this is an HTML5 document (`<!DOCTYPE html>`).
   - **HTML and Metadata**: The `<html>` tag is set with language `en` (English). Inside the `<head>`, the character encoding (`UTF-8`) and viewport settings for mobile responsiveness are defined.

2. **Page Title and Stylesheet**:
   - The `<title>` tag displays the page title as "To-Do List," surrounded by a `<marquee>` element, which animates the text (although `<marquee>` is outdated and not recommended).
   - The `style.css` file is linked to add custom styles to the page.

3. **App Layout**:
   - **Container and Box**: The main content is wrapped in a `<div class="container">` and `<div class="box">`, helping with layout and styling.
   - **To-Do App Section**: This section (`<div class="todo-app">`) holds the core elements of the to-do list:
     - **Title and Logo**: A title "To-Do List" (`<h1>`) and an image logo (`<img src="images/Logo.jpeg">`) are displayed at the top.
     - **Input Row**: Contains:
       - A text input (`<input type="text">`) with placeholder text "Add Your Text" for entering new tasks.
       - A date input (`<input type="date">`) with `id="exprieDate"` to select a due date for tasks.
       - Two buttons for adding tasks (`<button onclick="addTask()">`), though only one button is typically needed.

4. **Task List Display**:
   - **Task List Container**: The unordered list (`<ul id="list-container" class="scroll">`) serves as a placeholder for added tasks. Each task will likely be appended here via JavaScript.

5. **JavaScript Functionality**:
   - The `<script src="script.js">` tag includes an external JavaScript file (`script.js`), which will manage interactivity such as adding tasks to the list, marking tasks as complete, and potentially setting due dates.

In summary, this code provides a basic structure for a to-do list application, including inputs for task entry and a due date, as well as a section for displaying tasks. The visual styling and interactive functionalities will be handled by the linked CSS and JavaScript files.
